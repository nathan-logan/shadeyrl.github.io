        <h1>What is 6Mans?</h1>

        <p>6Mans is a competitive PUG system acting as a more competitive alternative to the in-game Rocket League ranked system. Its main goal is to provide an environment where games are taken more seriously and players can improve exponentially with other like-minded individuals.</p>

                        <h3>6Mans first launches in Oceania</h3>
                        <p>First developed by shadey, the 6Mans platform was designed to only include the top players in the
                            Oceanic region. As the popularity of the system grew, it was slowly expanded to include all players
                            in the region who were at least Diamond 1 in the in-game ranked playlists.
                            <br> As more and more people became interested he enlisted the help of
                            <a href="https://twitter.com/Plitz_RL"
                                target="_blank">Plitz</a> as the lead developer, and
                            <a href="https://twitter.com/Daze_RL">Daze</a> as an admin in order to maintain and improve the project. Shortly thereafter we had
                            a Discord bot and website where players could queue into games, report their scores and see their
                            win/loss record on a leaderboard.

                            After calls from international professional Rocket League players for a 6Mans-like PUG system, we decide to expand the platform to provide for a much larger playerbase.
